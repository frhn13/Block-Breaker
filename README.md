# Brick Breaker Game

I developed a brick breaker game where the user plays through three levels of increasing difficulty. There are a series
of powerups that can assist them as well. In addition, the game has an endless mode option which saves the score and time
lasted when the player dies, the player can then view the top 5 endless scores on a leaderboard.
